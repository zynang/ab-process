                <p> In this project, I ran a simple AB test on 2 different UI designs and conducted a brief statistical analysis of the results. From the results, I drew conclusions on whether a design choice could have reasonably impacted user interaction.<br>
                
                The webpage in question is a clinic's website. The target interaction was to book an appointment with a specific doctor, at a specific date and location. The original website is Version A below. Version B is the redesign that I completed in a short period of time.</p>

                <h2 class="sub-heading">Statistical Test</h2>
                <p>To evaluate the impact of the redesign, I ran statistical tests on each of the three data types</p>
                <div class="sketches">
                    <h3>1. Misclick Rate</h3>
                    <h4>Type of Test and Justification</h4>
                    <p>For this metric, I ran the Chi-Square test, since I am counting the occurrence of a misclick among users of Version A and Version B. The status of whether a misclick occurs is a categorical variable, since its either True or False among a sample of users. 
                    </p>
                    
                    <h4>Was the difference between the Versions statistically significant?</h4>
                    <p>It was statistically significant, since the p-value = 0.00462, where p-value < significance level (.05). The lower the p-value, the greater the statistical significance of the observed difference. This means that I can reject the null hypothesis, as there is a high chance the alternative hypothesis will repeat itself in other trials or situations.
                    </p>

                    <h4>A description of any other important values and what they tell us</h4>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Degrees of Freedom (DF) = 1. DF refers to the number of independent pieces of information in a test. since there are only 2 categories of answers, the test has 1 degree of freedom</li>
                        <li>Chi-Square Value = 8.02. The Chi-Square Value is a single number that adds up all the differences between our actual data and the data expected if there is no difference.  If the actual data and expected data (if no difference) are identical, the Chi-square value is 0.  A bigger difference will give a bigger Chi-square value.In this case, the Chi-Square value is mainly used to calculate the p value</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h4>Conclusion: Is the null hypothesis rejected?</h4>
                    <p>I reject the null hypothesis.</p>
                    
                    <h3>2. Time on Page</h3>
                    <h4>Type of Test and Justification</h4>
                    <p>For this metric, I ran the one-tailed t-test, because the time taken is a continuous variable, and I am only interested if the time on page for version A is greater than time on page for version B (single direction)</p>
                    
                    <h4>Was the difference between the Versions statistically significant?</h4>
                    <p>It was statistically significant, since the p-value = 0.0000627, where  p-value < significance level (.05). The lower the p-value, the greater the statistical significance of the observed difference. This means that I can reject the null hypothesis, as there is a high chance the alternative hypothesis will repeat itself in other trials or situations.

                    <ul>
                        <li>T-Score = -5.20. The T-Score is the number of standard deviations away from the mean of the t-distribution.</li>
                        <li>Avg(Version A) =  26861.71429;  Avg(Version B) =  9627.214286. This refers to the mean time taken on page per user</li>
                        <li>Variance(Version A) = 146407008.7, Variance (Version B) = 7429874.951. Variance measures of the spread or dispersion within a set of data, which means that there is a greater range of values in Version A than B, since its variance is greater.

                            P-Value = 0.0000627. The  p-value is the likelihood of finding a mean difference by chance if indeed there is no difference in the population. The low p value in this context indicates a statistically significant result, meaning the observed data provide strong evidence against the null hypothesis.
                        </li>

                    <h3>3. Number of Clicks</h3>
                    <h4>Type of Test and Justification</h4>
                    <p>For this metric, I ran the one-tailed t-test, because the number of clicks on a page till success is a continuous variable, and I am only interested if the number of clicks on page till success for version B is lower than version A (single direction)</p>
                    
                    <h4>Was the difference between the Versions statistically significant?</h4>
                    <p>It is statistically significant, since p-value = 0.0146, where  p-value < significance level (.05). The lower the p-value, the greater the statistical significance of the observed difference. This means that I can reject the null hypothesis, as there is a high chance the alternative hypothesis will repeat itself in other trials or situations.
